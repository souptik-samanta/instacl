This is a basic Instagram clone I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a header with a search bar and a theme toggle button, a section for stories, and a section for posts. There's also a side menu with profile suggestions. I used a default profile image for all users, as I didn't want to include any real photos.just had issue with scrooling and not much hope you like this project
